### CPSC 120

* Lab 1 
    Lab 1 as a whole was a great introduction to C++ as prior to that I had zero experience in it only in Python.
    It really set the groundwork for what to expect for the future and C++ as a whole.

* Lab 11
    Lab 11 was one of my personal favorites because it felt like a moment where I truly exceeded expectations
    and my own standards. I used pointers for the first time and while in the beginning, it was hard I ended up
    coming out of the lab feeling truly accomplished.

* Lab 12
    Lab 12 was a great instance in which I thought the material was hard but manageable.
    I loved using the Magk library because it was a breath of fresh air compared to the prior labs.
    Whereas we usually just make something kind of simple like a calculator for something, but in lab 12 we
    created an image that overall felt very cool.

Over all I can say that I truly did enjoy my time in 120, also Mr. Shafae was a great instructor.
Now I'm looking ahead to 121 in a good way.
